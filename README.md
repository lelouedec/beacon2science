# Beacon2Sciencee: Enhancing STEREO/HI beacon data1 with machine learning for efficient CME tracking


Code for the different components of the "Beacon2Science" pipeline. 

The different train and test .py files allow for reproducing the results of the paper from scratch once the data is processed and saved.

In the Data folder, the different functions used to create the datasets can be found, with examples on how to call them in the main function of each py file. For examples on how to use the data functions, the pipeline is provided in the RealTime folder to download specific times/latest images and produce enhanced beacon images.

The Tracking folder provides the tracking code used for the paper for all the events tracked.
